My brief thoughts on some topics/trends/technologies that would make sense for you to address are below:

•	Move away from Excel. Give exposure to multiple computer programming languages

o	Database or query languages like SQL would be a must

o	Statistical programming, like R or Python would also be a must (You could potentially consider making the R programming Coursera course a requirement before starting the program)

•	Classes that focus on practical projects working with real-world data. Taking a project from start-to-finish (gathering/cleaning data, testing different modeling techniques, communicating/visualizing the results)

o	Potentially work with companies in the region, so the students get exposure to business problems

•	Communication is very crucial within this industry, simply because most executives do not have the time or technical acumen to truly sit down and understand the entire analytical process. Thus, I would stress the portion of delivering and visualizing results to executives through presentations, proposals and things of that nature.

I hope this helps a bit. I would be more than happy to expand on this or answer any other questions that you may have.
