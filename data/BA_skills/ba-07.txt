I believe that a master degree in analytics should prepare the students to be grounded across a wide range of curve balls that they can be thrown at in the industry

- light knowledge across many statistical techniques to speak intelligently in business terms and understand what is better to use

- applied examples on how to solve a problem

- ability to continue dig deeper and show curiosity we see that the most successful people are what I called hybrids - they are able to do on their own the most deeper analytics, but also able to speak in generic terms about the project they are working on ability to switch on an off analytics lingo is a touch skill

I would recommend to partner with other departments and have students working in cross functional teams to learn that skill set I am thinking if your student in a MS analytics do a project with some MA in marketing that is the best preparation they can have to deal with real world...
