I assume that your program design will cover many data science principles and traditional analytics topics. These are very well documented. I would stress that building fundamentals in what makes data science work is pretty important. What I like about data science as a base for an analytics program is that it blends statistics, tech, and creativity. Building a program that trains how to put these skills to work to create solutions that solve problems for business is critical. Candidates that demonstrate how they can trace the data to the business outcome and all the way back will get the job. I think most analytics programs miss that point. Often it is hard to learn unless the candidates have actual work experience. Perhaps creating a program that forces students to think about strategy and solution design is a step ahead of other programs that just focus on technical skills. Also, there are spaces that are just exploding right now and need analytics resources to stretch out of their comfort zone. Martech and adtech is a great example. Create a solution of how marketers can use their own data and scoring models to enhance media targeting and efficiency would be tremendous. It would be difficult to do this because the space is changing so fast, however, understanding how it is changing and staying ahead through making analytics products would really be some special training.
