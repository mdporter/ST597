I tend to agree that not enough programs sufficiently embrace the "Scientist-Practitioner" model - and too few walk the fine line you seem to be set on, balancing theory and practice.

I will take a bit of time to chew on your questions and will respond in a few days. I have a team of analysts just down the road from you in Birmingham that I am presently expanding, so it will certainly be in our mutual interest to set the right path - and continue the conversation.

To that point, I will be sure to let you know next time I'm heading down your way - and if you should ever want a guest speaker, be sure to let me know.
