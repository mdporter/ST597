I spoke with our business side as well to give you a greater understand.  I won’t speak to their expectations, but they recently hired a Director of Marketing Analytics and are currently hiring a Manager of Marketing Analytics (attached are the job descriptions).  This should give you an understanding of the expectations of someone who would want to work in the business side for a professional sports team.

Below I have also included a job for the Los Angeles Angels as that could give you more of an expectations. For myself, the biggest things are obviously a strong background in different database technologies and/or statistical and data modeling programs (R/SQL), from there is the more specific into Hockey (baseball or other industries).

I know that I have given you more of a job expectations and less of the topics and/or trends, but I thought this could be a start to the conversation, let me know what you think and we can further discuss.
