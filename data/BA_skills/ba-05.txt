I don’t know what curriculum you have currently planned, but have a couple of thoughts on what may be good preparation for graduate students in analytics.

- In addition to needing strong technical skills, namely the ability to query (SQL) and join tables in a variety of data sources & platforms, our junior analysts spend considerable time analyzing processes and trying to identify areas where a data-driven solution would add value, for example, auditing an entire population of Workers’ Compensation claims instead of a sample and then finding a way to improve a decision making process. They need to be very good at retrieving large amounts of data (this is a gap) being savvy with technology in a general sense, isn’t the same as highly proficient at being able to efficiently query and solve problems, the analysts that need a lot of time to get a clean data set end up pressed for time to actually analyze and ask follow-up questions.

- I think most companies are transitioning to more fully leveraging analytics their business, and students coming out of school today need to be prepared to help organizations make that transition, and it may be painful. Since decisions are already being made by organizations, analysts who are driving towards data-driven or data-influenced decisions are proposing a significant change…. and threat to existing people/protocols. Good communication skills and personal diplomacy is surprisingly valuable to us in our analysts to help avoid conflicts. I tell our analysts to be sure to speak with your partners in the language of business and not statistics.

- A strong knowledge of test/control, understanding of correlation vs. causality, statistical significance, is essential as many of your analysts will undoubtedly be tasked with gathering data to measure or justify an initiative or expense and will need to understand how to effectively deflect these requests or handle them, if appropriate. They will need to communicate effectively about results and be able to explain why a test should be widened, extended or make a case for a carefully designed test, vs. “we will compare region A before/after we made change x.” (Yuck)
