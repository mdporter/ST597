I'll say upfront I'm not the best person to be included in your data set considering I barely studied analytics in school. I was a mechanical engineering major who only got in this field because I wanted to work in baseball and it seemed like something I could do/learn.

My one comment would be I've had to perform a lot of database management and computer science-related tasks. I cannot say if this is just a field-specific thing or not. But it's something I would think should be covered.
